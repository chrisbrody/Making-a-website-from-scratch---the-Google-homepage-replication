#REPLICATE_GOOGLE 1.1 - Intro to replicating to Google home page
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, in this video I'm going to replicate the Google homepage.

I know you probably just watched a similar video with my brother Matt, doing the exact something.
so if you already completed the Google replica you can move on,
otherwise hang around and you'll see me go from start to finish building this website.

The site we we're gonna replica is codifyacademy.com/google, I have a link in the description for you.

#REPLICATE_GOOGLE 1.2 - Creating the files we need
Ok so first we going to set up our files, I know, you should have a template folder for your new projects, but for this I'm gonna go from scratch here.

I hope you enjoy the music and don't forget to pause when you need to add something to your project to keep pace. Remember I've been doing this for years so please pause the video when you need to and I'll catch you at the end.

#REPLICATE_GOOGLE 1.3 - Outro to to replicating to Google home page
That's is for this website replication, I hope you were able to follow along and build your own!
